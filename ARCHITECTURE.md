## 1. Strand Priority Algorithm and Fallthrough

**Source:** `src/strands/engine.sh`

### Overview

The strand engine is a **priority waterfall dispatcher**. It tries each strand in a fixed order and stops as soon as one reports that it found and processed work.

### Strand Order

| Priority | Strand   | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 1        | Pluck    | Primary work from the assigned workspace |
| 2        | Explore  | Discover work in other workspaces |
| 3        | Mend     | Maintenance: heartbeat checks, log rotation |
| 4        | Weave    | Create beads from documentation gaps |
| 5        | Unravel  | Propose alternative solutions for blocked beads |
| 6        | Pulse    | Proactive quality monitoring (security, deps, coverage, TODOs) |
| 7        | Knot     | Alert humans when the worker is persistently stuck |

### Return Value Contract

Each strand **must** return one of exactly two values:

- **`0`** – Work found and processed. The engine stops immediately and does not try subsequent strands.
- **`1`** – No work found. The engine falls through to the next enabled strand.

No other return values are defined. Strands that return other values produce undefined engine behavior.

### Enablement Check

Before dispatching to a strand, the engine calls `_needle_is_strand_enabled <strand_name>`. A strand can be in one of three states:

- **`true`** – Always enabled.
- **`false`** – Always disabled (skipped without executing).
- **`auto`** – Enabled/disabled based on the active billing model (see `config/billing_models.sh`).

Disabled strands are recorded as `$strand:disabled` in the `strand_results` diagnostic array.

### Fallthrough Behavior

When a strand returns `1`:

1. The engine emits a `strand.fallthrough` event carrying `from` and `to` strand names.
2. The engine records `$strand:no_work` in diagnostic state.
3. The engine advances to the next **enabled** strand (skipping any disabled ones in between).
4. If all strands return `1`, the engine records starvation diagnostics (enabled count, disabled count, full dispatcher context including workspace, agent, PATH, and `br` availability) and then sleeps before retrying.

## 2. Configuration Merge and Override Logic

**Source:** `src/lib/config.sh`

### Precedence (lowest → highest)

1. **Built-in defaults** — JSON blob in `_NEEDLE_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`
2. **Global config** — `~/.needle/config.yaml`
3. **Workspace config** — `<workspace>/.needle.yaml`
4. **Environment variables** — `NEEDLE_*` prefix overrides any file-based value

### Merge Process

```
defaults ──┐
           ├──► deep_merge ──► global result ──┐
global ────┘                                    ├──► deep_merge ──► final config
                                workspace ──────┘
```

The implementation calls `load_workspace_config()` which performs a three-level merge. Keys present at a higher level replace same-named keys at lower levels; nested objects are merged recursively (deep merge), not replaced wholesale.

**Merge backend (in order of preference):**

1. `yq` (YAML/JSON deep merge)
2. Python `PyYAML` (`deep_merge()` recursive function)
3. Basic string substitution (limited; used only when neither of the above is available)

### Accessing Config Values

```bash
get_config "limits.global_max_concurrent"   # dot-notation key access
get_workspace_config "strands.pluck"        # workspace-aware variant
```

### Key Configuration Sections

| Section | Example Keys |
|---------|--------------|
| `billing` | `model` (`pay_per_token` \| `use_or_lose` \| `unlimited`) |
| `limits` | `global_max_concurrent` (default 20), `providers.<name>.max_concurrent` |
| `strands` | `<name>` (`true` \| `false` \| `auto`) |
| `runner` | `polling_interval`, `idle_timeout` (duration strings, e.g. `300s`) |
| `effort.budget` | `daily_limit_usd`, `warning_threshold` |
| `mitosis` | `enabled`, `max_children`, `min_complexity` |
| `select` | `work_stealing_enabled`, `work_stealing_timeout` (default `1800s`) |
| `hooks` | `timeout`, `fail_action` (`warn` \| `abort` \| `ignore`) |
| `file_locks` | `timeout` (default `30m`), `stale_action` |

### Hot-Reload

The config is cached in memory. Every 15 worker loop iterations the runner checks `NEEDLE_CONFIG_CHECK_COUNTER` and calls `reload_config()`, which clears the cache and re-reads from disk. `clear_config_cache()` forces an immediate reload on the next `get_config` call.

---

## 3. Event Emission Flow and Guarantees

**Source:** `src/telemetry/events.sh`

### Event Envelope

All events are written as JSONL (one JSON object per line):

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-03-01T10:00:00.123Z",
  "event": "bead.claimed",
  "level": "info",
  "session": "needle-claude-anthropic-sonnet-alpha",
  "worker": "claude-anthropic-sonnet-alpha",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Emission API

```bash
_needle_emit_event <event_type> <level> [key=value ...]
```

- `_needle_telemetry_timestamp` produces ISO 8601 with millisecond precision.
- `_needle_telemetry_infer_level <event_type>` assigns a default level when none is provided:
  - `error.*` → `error`
  - `*.failed`, `*.retry` → `warn`
  - `debug.*` → `debug`
  - everything else → `info`

### Defined Event Types

| Domain | Events |
|--------|--------|
| Strand | `strand.started`, `strand.completed`, `strand.fallthrough`, `strand.skipped` |
| Bead   | `bead.claimed`, `bead.released`, `bead.claim_retry`, `bead.claim_exhausted` |
| Execution | `execution.started`, `execution.completed`, `execution.failed` |
| Heartbeat | `heartbeat.emitted` (every 30 s during idle) |
| Budget | `budget.warning` (at threshold), `budget.exceeded` |
| Knot   | `knot.false_positive_prevented`, `knot.db_corruption_false_positive_prevented` |

### Guarantees

| Property | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Synchronous write** | Events are flushed to `.needle/logs/events.jsonl` before the emitter returns |
| **Non-blocking on failure** | A write failure is logged to stderr but does not block or crash the worker |
| **Session tagging** | Every event carries `NEEDLE_SESSION` (format: `needle-<runner>-<provider>-<model>-<identifier>`) |
| **Ordering** | ISO 8601 millisecond timestamps establish a total ordering within a session |
| **FABRIC forwarding** | If `fabric.enabled`, events are also forwarded via a named pipe to an HTTP endpoint (non-blocking, background process) |

---

## 4. Bead Claim Atomicity Guarantees

**Source:** `src/bead/claim.sh`

### Claim Protocol

```bash
_needle_claim_bead --workspace <ws> --actor <actor> [--max-retries <n>]
```

Internally this calls:

```bash
br update <bead_id> --claim --actor <actor>
```

The `br` CLI executes this as a single **SQLite transaction** with `EXCLUSIVE` isolation. Only one concurrent caller can succeed; all others get exit code `4` (race condition).

### Retry Logic

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Race condition (exit 4) | Selects a different bead from the queue; retries atomically |
| Max retries exceeded | Emits `bead.claim_exhausted`; returns `1` (no work) |

Default max retries: `NEEDLE_CLAIM_MAX_RETRIES` (default `5`).

### Weighted Bead Selection

Before each claim attempt, `_needle_select_bead` chooses a candidate using weighted random selection:

| Priority | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| P0 | 10× |
| P1 | 5× |
| P2 | 2× |
| P3+ | 1× |

Selection uses cumulative distribution sampling and respects dependency constraints (beads blocked by open dependencies are excluded).

### Hook Integration

- **`pre_claim` hook** — called before the claim attempt.
  - Exit `2` → abort claim entirely.
  - Exit `3` → skip this bead (try next).
- **`post_claim` hook** — called after a successful claim.

Hooks fire within the atomic claim window so that skips and aborts are consistent with the database state.

### Release Mechanism

`_needle_release_bead` clears `status='open'`, `assignee=NULL`, `claimed_by=NULL`, `claim_timestamp=NULL` directly via (in preference order):

1. `sqlite3` CLI
2. Python `sqlite3` module
3. `br` CLI (fallback; works around a known CHECK constraint bug in `br` that prevents setting `status='open'` while `claimed_by` is still set)

### Unassigned-by-Default

New beads created by `_needle_create_bead` are auto-assigned to the creator then **immediately released** when `select.unassigned_by_default: true` (default). This prevents starvation when a single worker creates many beads. Exceptions:

- `human`-type beads remain assigned so they are visible to the human.
- Beads created with an explicit `--assignee` flag remain assigned.

---

## 5. File Locking Semantics and SLAs

**Source:** `src/lock/checkout.sh`

### Design Philosophy

- **Non-blocking** — Workers never wait for a lock. If a conflict is detected, a dependency bead is created and the current bead is deferred.
- **Self-healing** — Closing a bead releases all its file claims automatically.
- **Cross-workspace** — All NEEDLE workers on the same machine share a single lock namespace.
- **Volatile** — Locks live in `/dev/shm/needle` (RAM-backed tmpfs); they are automatically cleaned up on reboot.

### Lock File Location and Naming

```
/dev/shm/needle/{bead-id}-{path-uuid}
```

`path-uuid` = first 8 characters of the MD5 hash of the absolute file path.

### Lock File Contents

```json
{
  "bead": "nd-2ov",
  "worker": "claude-code-glm-5-alpha",
  "path": "/home/coder/NEEDLE/src/cli/run.sh",
  "type": "write",
  "ts": 1709337600,
  "workspace": "/home/coder/NEEDLE"
}
```

### SLA / Timeout Behavior

| Config Key | Default | Meaning |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `file_locks.timeout` | `30m` | Age at which a lock is considered stale |
| `file_locks.stale_action` | `warn` | `warn` \| `release` \| `ignore` |

Stale locks are detected during checkout and logged. `stale_action: release` will delete the stale lock file and allow the new claim to proceed. `stale_action: warn` logs the staleness but still blocks the new claim (creating a dependency bead).

### Checkout Flow

1. `_needle_lock_ensure_dir` — creates `/dev/shm/needle` atomically if missing.
2. `_needle_lock_path_uuid <filepath>` — computes the 8-char hash identifier.
3. `_needle_lock_file_path <bead_id> <filepath>` — builds the full lock file path.
4. Inspect existing lock (if any): check `ts` against timeout; apply `stale_action`.
5. `_needle_lock_write_info` — atomically writes lock JSON with current timestamp.
6. On conflict: emit telemetry event, create a dependency bead, defer current bead.

## 6. Worker Coordination Protocol

**Source:** `src/runner/loop.sh`, `src/runner/state.sh`, `src/runner/limits.sh`

### Worker Lifecycle

```
Start
  └─► Register (state/workers.json)
        └─► Heartbeat loop (30 s)
              └─► [Strand Engine → Claim → Execute → Record]
                    └─► Graceful Shutdown (drain current bead, unregister)
```

### Registration

`_needle_register_worker` writes an entry to `~/.needle/state/workers.json` using `flock`-based atomic updates. Fields include: session ID, runner, provider, model, identifier, PID, workspace, start time. A duplicate-session check prevents double-registration.

Session ID format: `needle-<runner>-<provider>-<model>-<identifier>`

### Heartbeat Protocol

Each worker maintains a heartbeat file at:

```
~/.needle/state/heartbeats/${NEEDLE_SESSION}.json
```

Updated every **30 seconds** (configurable). Structure:

```json
{
  "worker": "needle-claude-anthropic-sonnet-alpha",
  "pid": 12345,
  "started": "2026-03-01T10:00:00Z",
  "last_heartbeat": "2026-03-01T10:02:15Z",
  "status": "executing",
  "current_bead": "nd-123",
  "bead_started": "2026-03-01T10:02:00Z",
  "strand": 1,
  "workspace": "/home/coder/NEEDLE",
  "agent": "claude-anthropic-sonnet",
  "queue_depth": 1
}
```

`status` values: `idle`, `executing`, `draining`, `starting`.

### Concurrency Enforcement

Limits are checked before a worker begins processing a bead. Three independent tiers are applied:

| Tier | Config Key | Default |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Global | `limits.global_max_concurrent` | 20 |
| Provider | `limits.providers.<name>.max_concurrent` | 10 |
| Model/Agent | `limits.models.<agent>.max_concurrent` | — |

Worker counts are derived from active entries in `workers.json`.

### Rate Limiting

A sliding-window rate limiter tracks requests per provider:

- State file: `~/.needle/state/rate_limits/{provider}.json` — array of ISO 8601 request timestamps.
- Window: last 60 seconds.
- Config: `limits.providers.<provider>.requests_per_minute`.
- On each request: prune timestamps outside the window, count remaining, enforce limit.

### Graceful Shutdown

`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`, and `SIGHUP` all trigger drain mode:

1. Worker finishes its current bead normally.
2. Worker does not pick up any new beads.
3. `_needle_unregister_worker <session>` removes the entry from `workers.json`.
4. A 5-second grace period allows background processes to clean up.

### Backoff and Crash Recovery

Persistent failures trigger exponential backoff:

| Failure count | Backoff delay |
|---------------|---------------|
| < 3 | None |
| 3–4 | 30 s |
| 5–6 | 60 s |
| > 6 | 120 s (max) |

At threshold `5`, a warning is emitted. At `7` consecutive failures the worker exits. `NEEDLE_FAILURE_COUNT` resets to `0` after any successful bead completion.

## 7. Telemetry Pipeline

**Source:** `src/telemetry/events.sh`, `src/telemetry/tokens.sh`, `src/telemetry/budget.sh`, `src/telemetry/effort.sh`, `src/telemetry/fabric.sh`, `src/dashboard/server.py`, `src/cli/dashboard.sh`

### Four-Tier Architecture

```
Worker action
    │
    ▼
Tier 1: Event Emission        ─── JSONL ──► ~/.needle/logs/events.jsonl
    │                                              │
    ▼                                          (optional)
Tier 2: Token & Cost Tracking ─── JSONL ──► ~/.needle/logs/effort.jsonl
    │
    ▼
Tier 3: Budget Enforcement    ─── blocks worker if limit exceeded
    │
    ▼
Tier 4: FABRIC Forwarding     ─── HTTP ──► POST /ingest (async, non-blocking)
                                                  │
                                                  ▼
Tier 5: FABRIC Dashboard      ─── SSE  ──► browser (needle dashboard start)
```

### Tier 1 — Event Emission

All structured events are appended to `$NEEDLE_LOG_FILE` (default `~/.needle/logs/events.jsonl`) synchronously. See [Section 3](#3-event-emission-flow-and-guarantees) for the full event schema and API.

### Tier 2 — Token and Cost Tracking

`_needle_extract_tokens_json <output_file>` parses AI model output and returns `"input_tokens|output_tokens"`. It handles multiple JSON response shapes:

- `{input_tokens, output_tokens}`
- `{usage: {input_tokens, output_tokens}}`
- `{usage: {prompt_tokens, completion_tokens}}`
- `{tokens: {input, output}}`

Returns `"0|0"` when no token data is found.

**Cost formula:**

```
cost = (input_tokens / 1000) × input_per_1k  +  (output_tokens / 1000) × output_per_1k
```

Per-agent rates are defined in `config/agents/*.yaml`:

```yaml
cost:
  type: pay_per_token
  input_per_1k: 0.003
  output_per_1k: 0.015
```

Each bead's token usage and cost are recorded as a JSONL entry in `~/.needle/logs/effort.jsonl`.

### Tier 3 — Budget Enforcement

| Config Key | Default | Meaning |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `effort.budget.daily_limit_usd` | `50.0` | Hard daily spend ceiling |
| `effort.budget.warning_threshold` | `0.8` | Fraction of limit that triggers a warning |

Before each bead, `get_daily_spend()` sums today's `effort.jsonl` entries and compares against the limit:

- At **80%** of limit: emit `budget.warning` event (worker continues).
- At **100%** of limit: emit `budget.exceeded` event; worker stops accepting new beads.

Enforcement is modulated by billing model:

| Model | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `pay_per_token` | Strict enforcement at 100% |
| `use_or_lose` | Soft warning at threshold; loose enforcement |
| `unlimited` | No enforcement |

### Tier 4 — FABRIC Forwarding

When `fabric.enabled: true`, events are forwarded in real time to an external HTTP endpoint:

1. A background process opens a named pipe at `/tmp/needle-fabric-{pid}.pipe`.
2. `_needle_emit_event` writes each event to the pipe (non-blocking write).
3. The background forwarder reads from the pipe and POSTs JSONL batches to `fabric.endpoint`.
4. If the endpoint is unreachable, the forward fails silently; local JSONL files are unaffected.

Config keys: `fabric.enabled`, `fabric.endpoint`, `fabric.timeout`.

### Tier 5 — FABRIC Dashboard (consumer)

**Source:** `src/dashboard/server.py`, `src/cli/dashboard.sh`

The FABRIC Dashboard is the consumer side of the telemetry pipeline: a standalone Python HTTP server that receives forwarded events and serves a live browser UI. It requires no external services — the server and dashboard are self-contained.

**Architecture:**

```
NEEDLE workers
  → fabric.sh: POST /ingest → Dashboard server (src/dashboard/server.py)
                                   │
                          in-memory ring buffer (last 10k events)
                                   │
                    ┌──────────────┴───────────────┐
                    │                               │
             GET /stream (SSE)              GET / (dashboard HTML)
                    │
              browser clients
```

**Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/ingest` | POST | Receive a JSONL event from fabric.sh |
| `/stream` | GET | SSE stream — pushes new events to connected browsers |
| `/` | GET | Self-contained dashboard HTML (no CDN, no build step) |
| `/api/summary` | GET | Aggregate stats: active workers, beads/min, cost today, failures |
| `/api/costs` | GET | Per-bead cost breakdown from `effort.recorded` events (sorted desc) |
| `/api/throughput` | GET | 30-minute bead completion history for the sparkline |
| `/api/events` | GET | Last N buffered events |
| `/health` | GET | Liveness probe: `{"status": "ok", "uptime": "..."}` |

**Dashboard panels:**

- **Active workers** — name, current bead, elapsed time, tokens this session
- **Strand activity** — per-strand run counts and last-run timestamps
- **Bead throughput** — completions/min over time (30-minute sparkline)
- **Cost tracker** — daily spend vs. budget, per-worker and per-bead breakdown
- **Recent events** — live tail of the last 50 events with type-based coloring
- **Failure alerts** — highlighted rows for `bead.failed` and `budget.warning` events

**CLI integration (`needle dashboard`):**

```bash
needle dashboard start              # Start in background (daemonized via nohup)
needle dashboard start --foreground # Start in foreground
needle dashboard start --port 3000  # Custom port
needle dashboard start --open       # Start and open browser
needle dashboard status             # Check liveness (reads PID file + kill -0)
needle dashboard stop               # Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 10s)
needle dashboard restart            # stop + start
needle dashboard logs [--follow]    # Tail ~/.needle/logs/dashboard.log
```

PID file: `~/.needle/dashboard.pid`. Log file: `~/.needle/logs/dashboard.log`.

**Startup seeding:**

Pass `--seed-file <events.jsonl>` to pre-populate the ring buffer from an existing log.
The seeding pass also updates the throughput sparkline for historical `bead.completed` events.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
dashboard:
  port: 7842        # Default port
  host: localhost   # Bind address; use "0.0.0.0" for Tailscale/remote access

fabric:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: http://localhost:7842/ingest
```

**Cluster deployment (persistent access):**

The dashboard can also run as a container in ardenone-cluster for persistent
access at `https://needle-dashboard.ardenone.com`. Manifests live at:

```
ardenone-cluster/cluster-configuration/ardenone-cluster/needle-dashboard/
├── namespace.yml                    # needle namespace
├── configmap.yml                    # server.py (stdlib only, no extra deps)
├── deployment.yml                   # python:3.12-slim + mounted ConfigMap
├── service.yml                      # ClusterIP port 80 → 7842
├── ingressroute.yml                 # Traefik + Let's Encrypt TLS
└── needle-dashboard-application.yml # ArgoCD Application (auto-sync)
```

Workers forward events to the cluster deployment with:

```yaml
fabric:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: https://needle-dashboard.ardenone.com/ingest
```

### File Layout

```
~/.needle/logs/
├── events.jsonl              # All structured events (append-only)
├── effort.jsonl              # Token usage and cost per bead
├── heartbeats/
│   └── {session}.json        # Per-worker heartbeat state
└── rate_limits/
    └── {provider}.json       # Sliding-window rate limit state
```

### Telemetry Guarantees

| Property | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Durability** | JSONL entries are flushed to disk synchronously |
| **Ordering** | ISO 8601 millisecond timestamps; monotonic within a session |
| **No loss on write failure** | Failed writes log to stderr but do not propagate errors |
| **Non-blocking forwarding** | FABRIC pipe writes are non-blocking; slow endpoints don't stall workers |
| **No PII** | Bead IDs and file paths are the only identifiers; no user data is recorded |

## 8. Hook Error Handling Specification

**Source:** `src/hooks/runner.sh`, `src/hooks/validate.sh`

### Overview

NEEDLE exposes 11 lifecycle hook points where users can run custom scripts. This section specifies exactly how hook failures are handled, what timeout behavior means, and how hook outcomes propagate into the bead lifecycle.

### Hook Points and When They Fire

| Hook | Fires when | Blocking? |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `pre_claim` | Before a bead is claimed | Yes — abort or skip affects claim |
| `post_claim` | After a successful claim | No — failure only logs |
| `pre_execute` | Before bead execution begins | Yes — abort stops execution |
| `post_execute` | After execution completes (success or failure) | No — failure only logs |
| `pre_complete` | Before a bead is marked completed | Yes — abort keeps bead open |
| `post_complete` | After a bead is marked completed + locks released | No |
| `on_failure` | When bead execution fails | Yes — abort skips retry, goes to quarantine |
| `on_quarantine` | When a bead enters quarantine state | No — bead already quarantined |
| `pre_commit` | Before a git commit is made | Yes — abort stops the commit |
| `post_task` | After the full task cycle completes | No |
| `error_recovery` | When an unhandled error is caught | No — advisory only |

### Exit Code Contract

All hook scripts communicate outcome via exit code:

| Exit Code | Constant | Meaning | Effect |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| `0` | `NEEDLE_HOOK_EXIT_SUCCESS` | Hook succeeded | Continue normally |
| `1` | `NEEDLE_HOOK_EXIT_WARNING` | Non-fatal issue | Log warning, continue |
| `2` | `NEEDLE_HOOK_EXIT_ABORT` | Hard stop | Abort current operation (see per-hook semantics) |
| `3` | `NEEDLE_HOOK_EXIT_SKIP` | Skip signal | Runner returns `2`; caller skips to next bead |
| `124` | `NEEDLE_HOOK_EXIT_TIMEOUT` | Timed out | Handled per `fail_action` config |
| Other | — | Unexpected failure | Handled per `fail_action` config |

Exit codes `2` (abort) and `3` (skip) are only meaningful for **blocking** hooks (see table above). Non-blocking hooks receive the same exit codes but the runner converts them to warnings rather than propagating the abort.

### Timeout Behavior

The `hooks.timeout` config key (default `30s`) caps how long any hook may run. The `timeout` command enforces this; if the hook process does not exit within the limit, it receives `SIGTERM` and exit code `124` is returned.

What happens after a timeout depends on `hooks.fail_action`:

| `fail_action` | Timeout outcome |
|---------------|----------------|
| `warn` (default) | Log warning, return success to caller — execution continues |
| `abort` | Return failure to caller — current operation is aborted |
| `ignore` | Silently continue — same as `warn` but without the log message |

Timeout is **not retried**. The hook invocation is abandoned and the action proceeds according to `fail_action`.

### `fail_action` — General Failure Policy

`hooks.fail_action` also governs how **unexpected exit codes** (anything other than 0–3) are handled:

| `fail_action` | Non-zero, non-abort exit code |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `warn` | Log warning, return success — caller continues |
| `abort` | Emit `hook.failed` event, return failure — caller aborts |
| `ignore` | Silently continue |

This policy does **not** affect exit code `2` (abort): that always propagates as a failure regardless of `fail_action`.

### Error Propagation to Bead Lifecycle

#### `on_failure` hook

Called when bead execution exits with a non-zero code or an unhandled error occurs.

- **Exit `0` or `1`**: Standard failure handling proceeds — the bead is eligible for retry according to the worker's backoff schedule.
- **Exit `2` (abort)**: Retry is skipped. The bead is moved directly to quarantine, triggering the `on_quarantine` hook.
- **Exit `3` (skip)**: Treated the same as exit `0` — standard retry logic applies.
- **Timeout**: Handled per `fail_action`; on `abort`, same effect as exit `2`.

File locks held by the bead are released regardless of `on_failure` exit code (the lock-release call in `_needle_hook_on_failure` always runs).

#### `on_quarantine` hook

Called when a bead enters quarantine state (either from explicit quarantine action, repeated failures, or `on_failure` exit `2`).

- **Exit `0` or `1`**: Quarantine proceeds normally — bead is left in quarantine awaiting human intervention.
- **Exit `2` (abort)**: Ignored. The bead is already quarantined and the abort has no further effect.
- **Exit `3` (skip)**: Remaining `on_quarantine` hooks for this event are skipped; quarantine state is preserved.

#### Retry vs. Quarantine Decision Matrix

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `on_failure` exits `0` or `1` | Bead retried per backoff schedule |
| `on_failure` exits `2` | Bead quarantined immediately (no retry) |
| `on_failure` exits `3` | Bead retried (skip treated as success) |
| `on_failure` times out + `fail_action=abort` | Bead quarantined |
| `on_failure` times out + `fail_action=warn` | Bead retried |
| Bead fails N times (force_threshold) | **Forced mitosis attempted** before quarantine |
| Forced mitosis succeeds | Bead split into children, parent released as blocked-by-children |
| Forced mitosis fails (atomic) | Bead quarantined |
| Worker consecutive failures ≥ 7 | Worker exits (see Section 6) |

### Hook Invocation Guarantees

1. **At-most-once per event**: A hook fires once per lifecycle event. There is no automatic retry of the hook itself.
2. **Non-recursive**: Hooks cannot trigger additional lifecycle hooks.
3. **Environment isolation**: Each hook runs in a subprocess. Variables exported by the hook do not affect the parent worker.
4. **Lock release on close**: `post_complete` and `on_failure` both call `_needle_release_bead_locks_on_close`. File locks are always released when a bead terminal state is reached, even if the hook itself fails.
5. **No hook chaining**: Each hook point supports exactly one script path. To run multiple actions, the single script must orchestrate them.

### Configuration Reference

```yaml
hooks:
  timeout: 30s            # Max runtime per hook invocation (default: 30s)
  fail_action: warn       # What to do on unexpected failure: warn | abort | ignore
  pre_claim:    ~/.needle/hooks/pre-claim.sh
  post_claim:   ~/.needle/hooks/post-claim.sh
  pre_execute:  ~/.needle/hooks/pre-execute.sh
  post_execute: ~/.needle/hooks/post-execute.sh
  pre_complete: ~/.needle/hooks/pre-complete.sh
  post_complete: ~/.needle/hooks/post-complete.sh
  on_failure:   ~/.needle/hooks/on-failure.sh
  on_quarantine: ~/.needle/hooks/on-quarantine.sh
  pre_commit:   ~/.needle/hooks/pre-commit.sh
  post_task:    ~/.needle/hooks/post-task.sh
  error_recovery: ~/.needle/hooks/error-recovery.sh
```

Workspace-level config (`.needle.yaml` in the workspace root) overrides global config for all hook settings. This allows per-project hook scripts without affecting other workspaces.

### Telemetry Events

The hook runner emits structured events for observability:

| Event | When emitted |
|-------|-------------|
| `hook.started` | Before hook script is executed |
| `hook.completed` | After hook exits `0`, `1`, or `3` |
| `hook.failed` | After hook exits `2` or exceeds timeout with `fail_action=abort` |

All events carry `hook_name`, `bead_id`, `exit_code`, and `duration_ms` fields.

## 9. Bead Verification System

**Source:** `src/bead/verify.sh`, `src/strands/pluck.sh`

### Overview

Beads can carry an optional `verification_cmd` field — a shell command that NEEDLE runs after agent execution to independently verify the definition of done. This allows the done condition to live in the bead itself rather than in NEEDLE, keeping NEEDLE stateless.

- Absence of `verification_cmd` = current behavior (no change, no regression).
- Presence of `verification_cmd` = NEEDLE runs the command after agent exits `0`.

### Storing verification_cmd

`verification_cmd` is stored in one of two locations:

1. **`metadata.verification_cmd`** (preferred) — set by the Weave strand when generating beads from documentation gaps.
2. **Label `verification_cmd:<command>`** — used by the mitosis module when propagating the parent's `verification_cmd` to child beads.

`claim.sh` extracts the command during bead claim and caches it in `NEEDLE_CLAIMED_BEAD_VERIFICATION_CMD` so that `verify.sh` can use it without an additional `br show` call.

### Execution Flow

```
agent exits 0
  → _needle_verify_bead (src/bead/verify.sh)
      → no verification_cmd → skip (exit 2) → close bead [current behavior]
      → has verification_cmd → run up to 3x with NEEDLE_VERIFY_RETRY_DELAY between attempts
          → passes → close bead
          → fails consistently → self-correction re-dispatch
              → re-dispatch to same agent with original prompt + failure context appended
                  → agent exits 0 → re-verify
                      → passes → close bead
                      → fails → release bead to queue (retry/mitosis path)
                  → agent exits non-0 → release bead to queue

agent exits non-0
  → mark bead failed (unchanged behavior)
```

### Retry and Flakiness

- Retry delay: `NEEDLE_VERIFY_RETRY_DELAY` (default: `2` seconds).
- Max retries: `NEEDLE_VERIFY_MAX_RETRIES` (default: `3`).
- If the command passes after retries (not on first attempt), the bead is labeled `verification-flaky` for human review.

### Self-Correction Re-Dispatch

When the `verification_cmd` fails consistently:

1. `_needle_format_verification_failure_context` formats the failure (command, exit code, output) into a Markdown block.
2. The block is appended to the original agent prompt and the agent is re-dispatched once.
3. After the correction agent exits `0`, NEEDLE re-runs `_needle_verify_bead`.
4. If re-verification passes, the bead closes normally.
5. If it fails again, `_needle_release_bead` releases the bead with reason `verification_failed_after_correction`.

### verification_cmd in Mitosis

When a bead with `verification_cmd` is split by the mitosis module:

- If the LLM-generated child description includes an `affected_files` field, `_needle_perform_mitosis` attempts to adapt a pytest-style command to target that file.
- If no adaptation is possible, the parent's command is inherited as-is.
- The inherited command is stored in the child bead as a `verification_cmd:<cmd>` label, which `claim.sh` picks up.

### verification_cmd in Weave

The Weave strand's bead-generation prompt instructs the LLM to include a `verification_cmd` in generated beads when the done condition can be expressed as a shell command. Examples are provided in the prompt:

```
- pytest tests/test_foo.py -q 2>&1 | grep -q passed
- grep -q 'def new_function' src/module.py
- [[ $(wc -l < docs/api.md) -gt 50 ]]
```

Weave stores the command in `metadata.verification_cmd` when creating beads via `br create --metadata`.

### Telemetry Events

| Event | When emitted |
|-------|-------------|
| `bead.verification_passed` | Verification command passed |
| `bead.verification_retry` | Verification attempt failed, will retry |
| `bead.verification_failed` | All retries exhausted — verification failed |
| `bead.verified` | Canonical event: bead verified and ready to close |
| `bead.verify_self_correct` | Self-correction re-dispatch initiated |
| `bead.verify_self_correct_passed` | Self-correction succeeded |
| `bead.verify_self_correct_failed` | Self-correction also failed — releasing bead |

---

## 10. Bead Mitosis System

**Source:** `src/bead/mitosis.sh`

### Overview

The mitosis system automatically detects when a bead represents multiple independent tasks and splits it into child beads. This enables parallel work, reduces failure rates on complex tasks, and ensures children have enough context to be immediately actionable.

```
_needle_check_mitosis (entry point)
  → enabled guard, type/label skip, min_complexity gate
  → _needle_analyze_for_mitosis
      → _needle_build_mitosis_prompt (workspace context + bead details)
      → agent dispatch (LLM analysis) | heuristic fallback
      → returns JSON: {mitosis, reasoning, children[]}
  → mitosis == true → _needle_perform_mitosis
      → create child beads with inherited priority, labels, fields
      → wire blocked_by relationships
      → block parent bead by all children
      → release parent claim
```

### Entry Point: `_needle_check_mitosis`

```bash
_needle_check_mitosis <bead_id> <workspace> <agent>
# Returns: 0 if mitosis performed, 1 if not
```

Guard sequence (stops at first failure):

1. Mitosis enabled check (config + workspace override)
2. Type skip: bead type must not be in `skip_types` (default: `bug,hotfix`)
3. Label skip: bead must not have a label in `skip_labels` (default: `no-mitosis,atomic`)
4. Complexity gate: description must have at least `min_complexity` lines (default: 3)
5. Analysis via LLM or heuristic

Use `no-mitosis` or `atomic` labels on a bead to opt out of mitosis.

### Prompt Construction: `_needle_build_mitosis_prompt`

The prompt passed to the LLM includes both bead details and live workspace context:

```
# Mitosis Analysis Task
## Task Details
- ID, Title, Priority, Parent Labels, Description

## Workspace Context
### Relevant Files (first 50)         ← git ls-files | head -50
### Recent Commits (last 10)          ← git log --oneline -10
### Test Files                        ← git ls-files | grep -E 'test[_-]|spec|tests/'
```

The workspace context lets the LLM reference actual file paths in child descriptions and verification commands, making children immediately actionable rather than generic.

### Extended Child Output Schema

The LLM is required to produce structured child records:

```json
{
  "mitosis": true,
  "reasoning": "...",
  "children": [
    {
      "title": "Child task title",
      "description": "File-specific description referencing actual paths",
      "affected_files": ["src/auth.py", "tests/test_auth.py"],
      "verification_cmd": "pytest tests/test_auth.py -q",
      "labels": ["optional-domain-label"],
      "blocked_by": []
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`affected_files`**: Actual file paths from workspace context that this child modifies.
- **`verification_cmd`**: Specific shell command to validate the child's done condition.
- **`labels`**: Optional domain labels (system labels like `mitosis-child` and `parent-*` are added automatically and must not appear here).
- **`blocked_by`**: List of sibling indices or `"previous"` to express sequential dependencies.

### Field Inheritance in `_needle_perform_mitosis`

When creating child beads, `_needle_perform_mitosis` inherits several fields from the parent:

#### Priority
Parent priority propagates to all children via `br create --priority <n>`. A P0 parent produces P0 children; if the parent has no priority, it defaults to P2.

#### Labels
Non-system labels from the parent propagate to all children. System labels excluded from propagation:
- `mitosis-child` — would create circular labelling
- `parent-*` — child's parent is the current bead, not its grandparent

Every child always receives two system labels regardless of parent labels:
- `mitosis-child` — marks it as a product of mitosis
- `parent-<id>` — links it to the parent bead for `_needle_get_mitosis_children`

#### verification_cmd
The child's own `verification_cmd` takes priority. If a child has none, the parent's command is adapted or inherited:

1. **Adaptation**: If the parent command is a pytest/npm invocation and the child's `affected_files` includes a test file, the command is narrowed to target that file (`pytest tests/test_specific.py -q`).
2. **Fallback**: If no adaptation is possible, the parent's command is used as-is.
3. **No command**: If neither child nor parent has a `verification_cmd`, no verification step is added.

The resolved `verification_cmd` is stored in two places:
- Appended to the child's description as `**Verification:** \`<cmd>\`` for human readability.
- Added as a `verification_cmd:<cmd>` label so `claim.sh` can extract it without an extra `br show` call.

#### affected_files
Appended to the child's description as `**Affected files:** <list>` for human readability. Not stored as a separate field or label.

### Sequential Dependencies

`blocked_by: ["previous"]` in the child schema causes `_needle_perform_mitosis` to wire a `br update <child_id> --blocked-by <prev_child_id>` relationship. This models ordered work: e.g., a test-writing child blocked by the implementation child.

### Parent Mutation

After creating all children, `_needle_perform_mitosis` mutates the parent bead:

1. **Blocks parent by each child**: `br update <parent_id> --blocked-by <child_id>` — the parent auto-resolves when all children close.
2. **Releases parent claim**: `br update <parent_id> --release --reason mitosis` — workers claim children instead.
3. **Labels parent**: `br update <parent_id> --label mitosis-parent` — marks it as a split bead.

### Heuristic Fallback

When no agent dispatcher is available, `_needle_heuristic_mitosis_analysis` applies rule-based analysis:

| Signal | Indicator weight |
|--------|-----------------|
| ≥2 ` and ` conjunctions | +1 |
| Numbered list (`1.`, `2.`, …) | +1 |
| ≥3 bullet points | +1 |
| >5 distinct file extensions mentioned | +1 |
| Multiple `implement/add/create` verbs | +1 |

Score ≥ 2 triggers mitosis. Child titles are extracted from the description structure (numbered list items → bullet items → numbered fallback). The heuristic does not produce `affected_files` or `verification_cmd`; those are LLM-only.

### Configuration

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `mitosis.enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable mitosis globally |
| `mitosis.skip_types` | `bug,hotfix` | Bead types that never split |
| `mitosis.skip_labels` | `no-mitosis,atomic` | Labels that opt a bead out of mitosis |
| `mitosis.max_children` | `5` | Maximum child beads per mitosis event |
| `mitosis.min_children` | `2` | Minimum children required (else aborted) |
| `mitosis.min_complexity` | `15` | Minimum description lines to consider mitosis |
| `mitosis.timeout` | `60` | Agent analysis timeout in seconds |
| `mitosis.force_on_failure` | `true` | Enable forced mitosis on repeated failure |
| `mitosis.force_failure_threshold` | `3` | Failures before forced mitosis triggers |

All keys support workspace-level overrides via `.needle.yaml`.

### Telemetry Events

| Event | When emitted |
|-------|-------------|
| `bead.mitosis.check` | Complexity gate passed; entering LLM/heuristic analysis |
| `bead.mitosis.started` | Analysis confirmed split; child creation beginning |
| `bead.mitosis.child_created` | Each individual child bead created |
| `bead.mitosis.complete` | All children created, parent mutated |
| `bead.mitosis.failed` | No children were successfully created |
| `bead.force_mitosis.attempt` | Forced mitosis triggered for a repeatedly failing bead |
| `bead.force_mitosis.success` | Forced mitosis succeeded (children created) |
| `bead.force_mitosis.quarantine` | Forced mitosis failed (bead is atomic, will quarantine) |

### Forced Mitosis on Repeated Failure

**Source:** `src/runner/loop.sh` (per-bead failure tracking and forced mitosis functions)

When a bead fails repeatedly, the forced mitosis system treats persistent failure as evidence that the task is too coarse-grained. Instead of quarantining the bead (a dead end), forced mitosis attempts decomposition before giving up.

#### Failure Count Tracking

Each bead maintains a per-session failure count in `~/.needle/state/bead_failures.json`:

```json
{
  "nd-abc123": 2,
  "nd-def456": 1
}
```

The count is incremented on each bead failure and reset when:
- Mitosis succeeds (children created)
- The bead completes successfully

#### Triggering Forced Mitosis

Forced mitosis is triggered when a bead's failure count reaches `force_failure_threshold - 1` (default: after 2 failures, since threshold is 3). The check happens during worker loop failure handling:

```bash
# In _needle_process_bead failure handling
if _needle_check_forced_mitosis "$bead_id" "$workspace"; then
    if _needle_handle_forced_mitosis "$bead_id" "$workspace" "$agent"; then
        # Mitosis succeeded - parent released as blocked-by-children
        return 0
    else
        # Mitosis failed - bead is atomic, fall through to quarantine
        _needle_quarantine_bead "$bead_id" "force_mitosis_exhausted"
    fi
fi
```

#### Force Parameter to `_needle_check_mitosis`

When forced mitosis is triggered, `_needle_check_mitosis` is called with `force=true`:

```bash
_needle_check_mitosis "$bead_id" "$workspace" "$agent" "true" "$failure_count"
```

The `force=true` parameter has two effects:

1. **Bypasses `min_complexity` check** — Even short descriptions are analyzed for decomposition
2. **Appends forced decomposition notice** to the mitosis prompt:

   ```
   **Forced Decomposition Notice**
   This task has failed 2 times without success. Even if it appears atomic,
   find a way to decompose it into smaller verifiable steps. If decomposition
   is truly impossible, return mitosis: false.
   ```

#### Mitosis Outcome Paths

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Mitosis succeeds (children created) | Parent released as blocked-by-children, failure count reset |
| Mitosis fails (atomic or undecomposable) | Bead quarantined with reason `force_mitosis_exhausted` |
| Mitosis timeout or error | Bead quarantined with reason `force_mitosis_failed` |

#### Configuration

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `mitosis.force_on_failure` | `true` | Enable forced mitosis on repeated failure |
| `mitosis.force_failure_threshold` | `3` | Number of failures before forced mitosis is triggered |

Both settings support workspace-level overrides via `.needle.yaml`.

#### Telemetry Events

| Event | When emitted |
|-------|-------------|
| `bead.force_mitosis.attempt` | Forced mitosis triggered for a failing bead |
| `bead.force_mitosis.success` | Forced mitosis succeeded (children created) |
| `bead.force_mitosis.quarantine` | Forced mitosis failed (bead is atomic) |

#### Design Rationale

Quarantine is a dead end — quarantined beads are abandoned and require manual intervention. Forced mitosis transforms persistent failures into diagnostic signals for decomposition, preserving the original intent in child beads that workers can continue making progress on.

The principle is: **agent failure = bead too coarse**. If a task fails repeatedly, it's evidence that the task description is too broad or complex for single-shot completion. Decomposition creates smaller, verifiable steps that workers can succeed at.
